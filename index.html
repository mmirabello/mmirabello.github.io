          Post college my goal is to enter some kind of entry level tech job where I can begin to get some
          real world experience. For the long term I would like to end up in a job that is at least somewhat
           related to the automtive industry. This could be anything from running a performance shop to
           something like the programming the computer aspect of cars.
